# Ant-colony_TSP


This project brings the fascinating world of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to life! Inspired by the way real ants find the shortest paths to food, this implementation tackles the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Nodes (cities) and edges (paths) are visualized in a dynamic, force-directed layout, creating an interactive graph that adapts as you tweak parameters or add nodes.

It uses probabilistic methods inspired by ant behavior to find near-optimal paths in a weighted graph. The program includes dynamic graph creation, visualization, and pheromone-based updates for iterative improvement. Key features include a force-directed node layout, pheromone evaporation, and balancing heuristic weights (alpha and beta).
With each iteration, pheromone trails grow and fade, guiding virtual "ants" to explore and discover near-optimal paths. Written in C++, the project is modular, visually engaging, and designed for enthusiasts eager to experiment, learn, and contribute. Letâ€™s optimize together!
